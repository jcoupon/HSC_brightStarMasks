Contributor: Ben Granett

v 3.4 - Feb. 2012
- improved treatment of FITS masks
- now able to compile without FITS support with
  > make FITS=no
- prints out limits in command line format

v 3.3 - Dec 2011
- new option "-cd" to generate constant density
- added option descriptions for venice -h

v 3.2 - Nov 2011
- new option "-seed number" for the random number generator

v 3.1 - Oct 2011
- now supports fits mask file (".fits", image coordinates)

v 3.04 - Oct 2011
- corrected a bug in flagCat

v 3.01 - Oct 2011
- added "+EPS" in the algorithm to find an
object within a polygon (was incorrect in some
very rare cases)

v 3.0 - Oct 2011
- polygons are now stored in a tree with leaves
being either empty of polygons of small enough
to contain a few polygons only (currently set
to the mean size of polygons... this has probably to
be improved).

v 2.2 - Sept 2011
- gives the area with spherical coordinates option
- default output in the standard ouput: stdout

v 2.1 - July 2010
- some precisions added in Makefile and README
- in 'flagCat', the limits of the mask are no
longer used as "default". If no limits are
definied, an object oustide the mask limits will be
now properly considered as "outside the mask".

v 2.02 - Feb 2nd 2010
- minor changes (changed some of
printf formats to work with 64bit machines)

v 2.01 - March 5 2009
- bug corrected in flagcat (wrong ymax)

v 2.0 - Feb 16th 2009
- All parameters put in a single structure "Config".
- File reading improved and simplified.
- Now integrates random catalogue on a sphere.

v 1.02 - Jan 17th 2009
- the option format [-f] can be use in task 2.
- the limits options can be used in task 2.
- README updated.

V 1.01 - April 2nd 2008
- The pixelized mask limits can be definied by the user as well
as the random catalogue limits.
- More explanations added in the README file.

V 1.00 - March 26th 2008
- First version.
